Q:

- I want to know what to do with my takeaway coffeec up
- I want to know what can go into my home recycling
- I want to know alternatives/ideas to reduce creating waste to begin with

- Opening hours and prices per loads for landfills and dump shops with contact numbers.

- E-waste recycling areas with prices for different items
- where can I get rid of old batteries?
- A cool map of where there's recycling bins in the streets of central areas so when I'm walking around eating takeaways I can get rid of recycling in the right areas... Although in Wellington we will need recycling bins in the streets first I guess ;)

-  Is polystyrene recyclable?

- Things I have wondered about how to dispose of recently are light bulbs and lye. I'd like to know how things are recycled. Where does the soft plastic from the supermarket drop off points go? What do they do about glass bottles being all mixed up colour wise? How does the cardboard, plastic, and cans get sorted? What about plastic bottles that have a lid on made of different kind of plastic? I just feel like I really don't understand the recycling system past which bin I'm ment to put things in. I'd like videos of the recycling process.

- What can go in my worm bin and in what proportions.
    What facilities there are in my region for "compostable" stuff that isn't home compostable (for example, what to do with those stupid "eco-friendly" produce bags that need open air and multiple years to break down).

    Also, I'd really like to know where stuff gets recycled, and what materials are best to avoid in terms of how much trouble they are to recycle.
    And what regions in nz have better/worse recycling facilities and why (out of curiosity, but also to see if there's things we could be doing better locally).

    I would probably access the info on the computer rather than my phone, although checking opening hours and charges for dumps, greenwaste centres etc could be useful on the mobile.

    Most of the info mentioned could be in maps, tables, lists... But what about something like the Consumer website, where data is presented in a clear way, but there are also articles about the product/service, things to consider, advice etc.
