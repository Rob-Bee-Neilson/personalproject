- E-waste recycling areas with prices for different items
- where can I get rid of old batteries?
- A cool map of where there's recycling bins in the streets of central areas so when I'm walking around eating takeaways I can get rid of recycling in the right areas... Although in Wellington we will need recycling bins in the streets first I guess ;)

-  Is polystyrene recyclable?
Lydia M
- Things I have wondered about how to dispose of recently are light bulbs and lye. I'd like to know how things are recycled. Where does the soft plastic from the supermarket drop off points go? What do they do about glass bottles being all mixed up colour wise? How does the cardboard, plastic, and cans get sorted? What about plastic bottles that have a lid on made of different kind of plastic? I just feel like I really don't understand the recycling system past which bin I'm ment to put things in. I'd like videos of the recycling process.
